# Hi there, this is my portfolio ! 

I am Caroline Lefevre, a 25 years old developper based in Paris, recently reconverted from management with the 6 months The Hacking Project's Developper Program. I enjoy doing front applications using React and Next.js frameworks, but also working on backend with Ruby on Rails. I like to code beautifully simple and useful things, to make everyone's day better !

You can access my portfolio here : https://caro407.github.io/portfolio/.

It was developped using React and Tailwind.css.
